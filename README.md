# sync-locales-from-en

An AI skill that syncs locale translation files with `messages/en/` as the source of truth. Detects missing keys, translates them via LLM, and merges back — keeping key order and file structure intact.

Built for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) / [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) as an installable skill, but also works standalone via `pnpm` scripts.

## How it works

```
messages/en/main.json  (source of truth)
messages/de/main.json  (auto-synced)
messages/es/main.json  (auto-synced)
messages/fr/main.json  (auto-synced)
messages/zh/main.json  (auto-synced)
```

The pipeline:

1. **Compare** — find missing keys per locale
2. **Extract** — generate flat `draft/{locale}.json` files with `{file}::{dotpath}` keys
3. **Copy draft** — copy draft → translation (preserves interrupted work)
4. **Translate** — LLM translates `translation/{locale}.json` values
5. **Unflatten** — convert flat translated files back to nested JSON
6. **Merge** — write translations into `messages/{locale}/`, preserving key order
7. **Test** — validate all locales match en/ structure

## Usage

### Approach 1: AI skill (recommended)

If you have Claude Code or Kiro installed, just run:

```
/sync-locales-from-en
```

The AI agent handles the full pipeline automatically, launching parallel translation subagents per locale.

### Approach 2: Manual via pnpm

Run each step yourself:

```bash
pnpm i18n:compare      # find missing keys
pnpm i18n:extract      # generate draft files
pnpm i18n:copy-draft   # copy draft → translation
# ... translate translation/*.json yourself or with any LLM ...
pnpm i18n:unflatten    # convert flat → nested JSON
pnpm i18n:merge        # merge into messages/
pnpm i18n:test         # validate
```

The translate step is intentionally manual — use whatever LLM or translation service you prefer. The `translation/{locale}.json` files are flat JSON objects, easy to feed into any API.

## Intermediate format

Translation files use a flat JSON format to avoid broken nested JSON from LLM output:

```json
{
  "main.json::home.feature.title": "Welcome to our platform",
  "main.json::home.feature.description": "The best way to manage your projects",
  "ui.json::buttons.submit": "Submit"
}
```

Keys are never modified — only values get translated.

## Key ordering

Merged JSON files follow a specific key order at every nesting level:

1. `title` first
2. `description` second
3. Numbered keys (`1`, `2`, `3`...) sorted numerically
4. Everything else in original order

This is enforced by a custom JSON serializer since V8 always enumerates integer keys before string keys regardless of insertion order.

## Known issues

### Subagent output truncation

When a locale has many missing keys (200+), LLM subagents may truncate the output — writing only ~64 keys instead of the full set. This happens because the translated JSON exceeds the Write tool's practical limit in a single call.

**Workaround:** The `draft/` → `translation/` split helps here. If a subagent fails or truncates, `draft/` stays pristine. Delete the bad `translation/{locale}.json`, re-run `pnpm i18n:copy-draft`, and retry. For large key sets, consider splitting the work or instructing the subagent to use Edit instead of Write.

### Subagent freezing / interruption

Subagents can freeze or be interrupted mid-translation. The `translation/` layer preserves partially-completed work — `pnpm i18n:copy-draft` skips locales that already have a file in `translation/`, so completed translations aren't lost.
